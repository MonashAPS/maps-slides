## Greedy Algorithms {.smaller}
> A **greedy** algorithm constructs a solution to the problem by always making a choice that looks best at the moment. A greedy algorithm never takes back its choices, but directly constructs the final solution.

**Greedy** does not refer to a single algorithm, but rather an approach to solving a problem.

# Examples

## Coin Problem {.smaller}
Let's say with have $1$, $5$ and $10$ cent coins. What is the smallest number of coins to get a sum of $x$ cents.

What is the greedy approach to this problem?

. . .

> Repeatedly taking the **largest coin possible.**

. . .

But why does this work?

## Coin Problem - Proof {.smaller auto-animate="true"}
So we want to prove that the largest coin below the target amount is the optimal choice.

Let's start with the $1$ and $5$ cent coins.

. . .

![](1cent.webp){height="100px"}
![](1cent.webp){height="100px"}
![](1cent.webp){height="100px"}
![](1cent.webp){height="100px"}
![](1cent.webp){height="100px"}
![](1cent.webp){height="100px"}

. . .

No matter what, if we have $5$ cents or more, we can replace $5$ $1$-cent coins with a $5$ cent coin to make a more optimal solution.

## Coin Problem - Proof {.smaller auto-animate="true"}
So we want to prove that the largest coin below the target amount is the optimal choice.

Let's start with the $1$ and $5$ cent coins.

![](5cent.webp){height="100px"}
![](1cent.webp){height="100px"}

No matter what, if we have $5$ cents or more worth of $1$-cent coins, we can replace $5$ $1$-cent coins with a $5$ cent coin to make a more optimal solution. Hence it is always more optimal to take the $5$-cent coin.

## Coin Problem - Proof {.smaller auto-animate="true"}
Now consider the $10$-cent coins.

![](5cent.webp){height="100px"}
![](1cent.webp){height="100px"}
![](1cent.webp){height="100px"}
![](1cent.webp){height="100px"}
![](1cent.webp){height="100px"}
![](1cent.webp){height="100px"}
![](1cent.webp){height="100px"}

No matter how we use $1$ and $5$-cent coins, if we have at least $10$ cents, we can replace them with a $10$-cent coin to create a more optimal soluction. Hence it is always more optimal to take a $10$-cent coin.

## Coin Problem - Proof {.smaller auto-animate="true"}
Now consider the $10$-cent coins.

![](10cent.jpg){height="100px"}
![](1cent.webp){height="100px"}

No matter how we use $1$ and $5$-cent coins, if we have at least $10$ cents, we can replace them with a $10$-cent coin to create a more optimal soluction. Hence it is always more optimal to take a $10$-cent coin.

## Solution - Code
```python
i = int(input())

ans = 0
while i != 0:
    if i >= 10: # Take a 10-cent coin
        i -= 10

    elif i >= 5: # Take a 5-cent coin
        i -= 5

    else: # Take a 1-cent coin
        i -= 1
    
    # Add 1 to the coin count
    ans += 1

print(ans)
```

## Solution - Code (Better)
```python
i = int(input())

ans = 0

ans += i // 10 # Take as many 10-cent coins as possible.
i = i % 10

ans += i // 5
i = i % 5

ans += i

print(ans)
```

## Coin Problem - Extension {.smaller auto-animate="true"}
But what if we had $1$, $5$, and $13$-cent coins?

- Can we still use a greedy approach?
- Why/why not?
- If we can't how else can we approach this problem?

## Scheduling {.smaller}
Given $n$ events with their starting and ending times, find a schedule that includes as many events as possible without any events

What's a greedy approach to solving this problem?

. . .

We want to take the next event with the earliest end time.

We want to take the next event with the earliest end time.  

## Scheduling - Solution
```python
tasks = [(1,2),(3,4)] # Skipping input.

sort(tasks, key = lambda x: x[1]) # Sorting by end time.

current_time = 0
ans = 0

for (start,end) in tasks: 

    if (start < current_time): # Skip task if it begins before current time.
        continue
    
    # Perform current task, current_time is now the end time of the task.
    current_time = end
    ans += 1
    
```
